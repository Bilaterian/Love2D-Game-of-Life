# Love2D Game of Life
 My recreation of Conway's Game of Life made in Love 2D

 Features I want to add: 
 - Save to JPG -> saved to png instead
 - painting the canvas -> done
 - switching cell states on canvas -> done
    --pick between turning on cells and turning off cells
 - switch between painting and switching cells -> done
 - select colors from a palette -> done
 - possible improvements: change brush size? -> done
 - custom filenames, if empty saved as default
 - window opens up for filename and saved notification window
 - better indicators when something is pressed
 - custom cursors?
 - sound effects would be cool
 - current font sucks, change it so it looks cool
 - need better design overall
